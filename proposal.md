# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Goblite Slayer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It's a game built in Idle. It's a chance-based game, in which you defeat enemies based on what type of number the computer rolls.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is slightly based off of what Professor Rosen did in class a while ago. The game I plan to do will include but not limited to many features.
One featur would be to let the play choose their name, which is simple enough. Another feature is letting the player choose a sword.
There are (at least) 3 swords to choose from, all with different stats so that each have a different outcome in the battle. The first sword is a basic sword
which is optimal for normal gameplay. The second sword will be more luck based, as it can deal higher damage, but the player can recieve more damage than the other swords.
The third sword is kind of like an easy mode, as every succesful hit gives the player some health, but in return does lower damage than the rest of the swords.
There will be the option to use powerups. The powerups I have planned are healing potions, which heals you, and a damage potion, which increases your damage. There are a limited
quanity of potions, so i'll have the player use them carefully if they want to succeed. I also might plan to add in some sort of shop to buy the potions. You could get money
by defeating the enemies. There will be at minimum 6 fights in the game as to not make it too quick,and I'll have the first fight easy for the player, and the last fight kind of hard
for the player. I plan for each boss to have something unique rather than just increasing the health.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will accomplish
-Player name
-Sword choosing
-6 unique bosses
-Powerups

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish
-A shop option (For potions)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be all of the above. I can't think of any more options but I could look up more on how rpg games work, and if I could implement 
a feature from there onto this game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My steps would be to plan every unique boss. I need to see if a boss would be too hard on a player or too easy by multiple tests.
I will definitely need more modules, maybe more than we learned in class. If I have enough time, I would probably add more swords 
and bosses, but my minimum is 3 swords and 6 bosses. To gain some ideas, I would need to look into RPG games and its elements, and 
see if I could possibly implement it into the game.
