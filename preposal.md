# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Idea 1: Make an rpg-like game using Idle. The amount of things listed here are what I plan to do, but things could be added along the way
 -Player can choose name
 -Player can choose a weapon (at least 3 weapons)
 -Weapons all have different stats that can dictate the outcome of the game overall
 -Player will fight at least 6 enemies to not make it feel too fast (First boss should be easy to beat, last should be hard)
 -Power-ups will exist in the game. Health power-ups and boost potions are a must, but more power ups might be added.
 -Easter Eggs maybe?
 
 Idea 1 is the one I plan to do

Idea 2: Make a new gamemode in the game Overwatch using the built in creation tools. Creation tools include 
things that we have learned in class.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do the project by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any so far, but i'll be sure to notify the instructors once I have a question.
